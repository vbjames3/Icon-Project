<div class="flex">
<div class="container text">  <p> In 2021, New York saw more than double the number of hate crime incidents than 2020, jumping to 528 from 266, according to the <a href="https://app.powerbigov.us/view?r=eyJrIjoiYjg1NWI3YjgtYzkzOS00Nzc0LTkwMDAtNTgzM2I2M2JmYWE1IiwidCI6IjJiOWY1N2ViLTc4ZDEtNDZmYi1iZTgzLWEyYWZkZDdjNjA0MyJ9"> NYPD Hate Crimes Dashboard</a>. This year, the dashboard reported 338 incidents, despite the latest available data covering only up to June 28. </p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="flex">
<div class="container text">  <p> As the city faces an uphill battle in reversing the trend, Frank Pezzella, a John Jay College Associate Professor and hate crimes expert, says that "offenders have become much more emboldened" about perpetrating hate crimes during the recent spikes. But Pezzella says the hate crimes are obfuscated by difficulty in tracking its statistics. </p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="flex">
<div class="container text">
<p>"Hate offending is the most significantly under-reported crime," he said. "And that we have no idea about the scope, the severity, the prevalence of hate crimes." </p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="flex">
<div class="container text">
<p> Here's a look into some trends and how the city reached this point.</p>

<p> <b> The Pandemic </b> </p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="flex">
<div class="container text">
<p> Shortly after the pandemic, hate crimes rose dramatically. While the Asian American and Pacific Islander communities were primary targets of the pandemic, the crimes increased among the most susceptible groups, like Black people, homosexual men, and Jews. The hate crime incidents reported in the first six months of 2022 top the numbers for the entire year of 2019. While most cities and states have long moved past the pandemic, and New York City follows, the trend in hate crimes rising remains. </p>

<p> <b> The inability to identify the complete statistics </b> </p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="flex">
<div class="container text">
<p> In 2020, the latest available data, 13 New York counties reported no hate crime incidents, and an additional six counties reported two or fewer incidents but made no arrests, according <a href="https://www.criminaljustice.ny.gov/crimnet/ojsa/hate-crime-in-nys-2020-annual-report.pdf#:~:text=Hate%20Crime%20in%20New%20York%20State%202020%20Annual,%2835.8%25%29%2C%20crimes%20against%20individuals%20%28223%29%20increased%206.2%20percent.according"> to New York's Annual Hate Crimes report. </a> Some causes of the low-reported incidents include the victims not reporting incidents and difficulty in classifying and identifying a crime as a hate crime, among other inaccuracies. </p>

<p> <b> The need to embrace diversity </b> </p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="flex">
<div class="container text">
<p>While New York State has a greater population than New York City, it's far less diverse. However, the New York Hate Crimes report showed that non-NYC counties had 202 hate crime incidents in 2020, while New York City had 272. New York City counties also had only 10 more arrests for hate crimes. </p>

<p> <b> Policy </b> </p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="flex">
<div class="container text">
<p> Despite hate crimes existing before the <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime"> FBI started collecting data </a> on them in 1996, policy and political discourse could help reverse New York's hate crime trend. New York created a <a href="https://www.ny.gov/programs/hate-crimes-task-forceHate"> Hate Crimes Task Force </a> just four years ago in 2018 "to address the increase in bias-motivated threats, harassment and violence throughout New York State." While data collection to attempts at deterring the crimes remains new, promoting discourse and improved policy approaches could help reduce hate crimes in New York. </p>
